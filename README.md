# About Point Tracker

Hi! This is my first program and I've never written a readme before. I've been working on this for quite a while but I wouldn't call this a stable build, I'm still kind of figuring this all out.
In order to run this program, you'll want the .py file in the same folder as all the other files. It imports some modules that will need to be installed through pip, most notably PySimpleGUI. I'm working on getting this into an .exe so it's easier to run, but I'll certainly update once I have that done.

PointTracker is used to track points, pretty self-explanatory. There are tabs for goals and rewards: Goals add points, and rewards remove points. There's a history tab that shows the history of all your transactions. You can add and remove custom goals and rewards. Changes are permanent only after manually saving, so be careful not to close out without saving your progress!


If you have any questions, you can reach me by email at maxwebsites13@gmail.com.
Thanks for trying my program!
